; php-cgi-fcgi.ini - configuration used only for cgi-fcgi SAPI
;
; Please note that, unlikely in original php distributions, this file
; is read AFTER (not instead of) reading global /etc/php/php.ini.
;
; It allows you to control global settings for all SAPIs in one place
; and override some settings in SAPI-specific files without need of
; copying whole large php.ini.

[PHP]
; cgi.force_redirect is necessary to provide security running PHP as a CGI under
; most web servers.  Left undefined, PHP turns this on by default.  You can
; turn it off here AT YOUR OWN RISK
; **You CAN safely turn this off for IIS, in fact, you MUST.**
; http://php.net/cgi.force-redirect
;cgi.force_redirect = 1

; if cgi.nph is enabled it will force cgi to always sent Status: 200 with
; every request. PHP's default behavior is to disable this feature.
;cgi.nph = 1

; if cgi.force_redirect is turned on, and you are not running under Apache or Netscape
; (iPlanet) web servers, you MAY need to set an environment variable name that PHP
; will look for to know it is OK to continue execution.  Setting this variable MAY
; cause security issues, KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING FIRST.
; http://php.net/cgi.redirect-status-env
;cgi.redirect_status_env =

; cgi.fix_pathinfo provides *real* PATH_INFO/PATH_TRANSLATED support for CGI.  PHP's
; previous behaviour was to set PATH_TRANSLATED to SCRIPT_FILENAME, and to not grok
; what PATH_INFO is.  For more information on PATH_INFO, see the cgi specs.  Setting
; this to 1 will cause PHP CGI to fix its paths to conform to the spec.  A setting
; of zero causes PHP to behave as before.  Default is 1.  You should fix your scripts
; to use SCRIPT_FILENAME rather than PATH_TRANSLATED.
; http://php.net/cgi.fix-pathinfo
cgi.fix_pathinfo=1

; if cgi.discard_path is enabled, the PHP CGI binary can safely be placed outside
; of the web tree and people will not be able to circumvent .htaccess security.
; http://php.net/cgi.dicard-path
;cgi.discard_path=1

; FastCGI under IIS (on WINNT based OS) supports the ability to impersonate
; security tokens of the calling client.  This allows IIS to define the
; security context that the request runs under.  mod_fastcgi under Apache
; does not currently support this feature (03/17/2002)
; Set to 1 if running under IIS.  Default is zero.
; http://php.net/fastcgi.impersonate
;fastcgi.impersonate = 1

; Disable logging through FastCGI connection. PHP's default behavior is to enable
; this feature.
;fastcgi.logging = 0

; cgi.rfc2616_headers configuration option tells PHP what type of headers to
; use when sending HTTP response code. If set to 0, PHP sends Status: header that
; is supported by Apache. When this option is set to 1, PHP will send
; RFC2616 compliant header.
; Default is zero.
; http://php.net/cgi.rfc2616-headers
;cgi.rfc2616_headers = 0

; cgi.check_shebang_line controls whether CGI PHP checks for line starting with #!
; (shebang) at the top of the running script. This line might be needed if the
; script support running both as stand-alone script and via PHP CGI<. PHP in CGI
; mode skips this line and ignores its content if this directive is turned on.
; http://php.net/cgi.check-shebang-line
;cgi.check_shebang_line=1
