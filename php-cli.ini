; php-cli.ini - configuration used only for cli SAPI
;
; Please note that, unlikely in original php distributions, this file
; is read AFTER (not instead of) reading global /etc/php/php.ini.
;
; It allows you to control global settings for all SAPIs in one place
; and override some settings in SAPI-specific files without need of
; copying whole large php.ini.

[PHP]
; This combination (display_errors=off; log_errors=on; error_log ="") allows
; fatal errors go to STDERR only. We set these separately here, that we won't
; be affected by global php.ini
display_errors = Off
log_errors = On

; Disable error logging, in case it was enabled in global php.ini
error_log = ""

[Session]
; argument passed to save_handler in the case of files, this is the
; path where data files are stored.
session.save_path = /tmp
