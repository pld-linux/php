+;
+; Please note, that in PLD installations /etc/php/php.ini file
+; contains global settings for all SAPIs (cgi, cli, apache...),
+; and after reading this file, SAPI-specific file (/etc/php/php-cgi.ini,
+; /etc/php/php-cli.ini, /etc/php/php-apache.ini...) is INCLUDED
+; (so you don't have to duplicate whole large file to override only

 ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
-; All the values in the php.ini-dist file correspond to the builtin
-; defaults (that is, if no php.ini is used, or if you delete these lines,
-; the builtin defaults will be identical).
+; If you use constants in your value, and these constants belong to a
+; dynamically loaded extension (either a PHP extension or a Zend extension),
+; you may only use these constants *after* the line that loads the extension.
+
 
+; Below is the list of settings changed from default as specified in
+; php.ini-recommended. These settings make PHP more secure and encourage
+; cleaner coding.
+; The price is that with these settings, PHP may be incompatible with some old
+; or bad-written applications, and sometimes, more difficult to develop with.
+; Using this settings is warmly recommended for production sites.  As all of
+; the changes from the standard settings are thoroughly documented, you can
+; go over each one, and decide whether you want to use it or not.
+;
+; - register_globals = Off         [Security, Performance]
+;     Global variables are no longer registered for input data (POST, GET, cookies,
+;     environment and other server variables).  Instead of using $foo, you must use
+;     you can use $_REQUEST["foo"] (includes any variable that arrives through the
+;     request, namely, POST, GET and cookie variables), or use one of the specific
+;     $_GET["foo"], $_POST["foo"], $_COOKIE["foo"] or $_FILES["foo"], depending
+;     on where the input originates.  Also, you can look at the
+;     import_request_variables() function.
+;     Note that register_globals = Off is the default setting since PHP 4.2.0.
+; - display_errors = Off           [Security]
+;     With this directive set to off, errors that occur during the execution of
+;     scripts will no longer be displayed as a part of the script output, and thus,
+;     will no longer be exposed to remote users.  With some errors, the error message
+;     content may expose information about your script, web server, or database
+;     server that may be exploitable for hacking.  Production sites should have this
+;     directive set to off.
+; - log_errors = On                [Security]
+;     This directive complements the above one.  Any errors that occur during the
+;     execution of your script will be logged (typically, to your server's error log,
+;     but can be configured in several ways).  Along with setting display_errors to off,
+;     this setup gives you the ability to fully understand what may have gone wrong,
+;     without exposing any sensitive information to remote users.
+; - error_reporting = E_ALL        [Code Cleanliness, Security(?)]
+;     By default, PHP surpresses errors of type E_NOTICE.  These error messages
+;     are emitted for non-critical errors, but that could be a symptom of a bigger
+;     problem.  Most notably, this will cause error messages about the use
+;     of uninitialized variables to be displayed.
+; - register_argc_argv = Off       [Performance]
+;     Disables registration of the somewhat redundant $argv and $argc global
+;     variables.
+; - magic_quotes_gpc = Off         [Performance]
+;     Input data is no longer escaped with slashes so that it can be sent into
+;     SQL databases without further manipulation.  Instead, you should use the
+;     function addslashes() on each input element you wish to send to a database.
+; - variables_order = "GPCS"       [Performance]
+;     The environment variables are not hashed into the $HTTP_ENV_VARS[].  To access
+;     environment variables, you can use getenv() instead.
+
+; For completeness, below is list of the rest of changes recommended for
+; performance, but NOT applied in default php.ini in PLD (since they are
+; not needed for security or may cause problems with some applications
+; more likely than above).
+
+; - output_buffering = 4096        [Performance]
+;     Set a 4KB output buffer.  Enabling output buffering typically results in less
+;     writes, and sometimes less packets sent on the wire, which can often lead to
+;     better performance.  The gain this directive actually yields greatly depends
+;     on which Web server you're working with, and what kind of scripts you're using.
+; - allow_call_time_pass_reference = Off     [Code cleanliness]
+;     It's not possible to decide to force a variable to be passed by reference
+;     when calling a function.  The PHP 4 style to do this is by making the
+;     function require the relevant argument by reference.
