-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
-; This file controls many aspects of PHP's behavior.  In order for PHP to
-; read it, it must be named 'php.ini'.  PHP looks for it in the current
-; working directory, in the path designated by the environment variable
-; PHPRC, and in the path that was defined in compile time (in that order).
-; Under Windows, the compile-time path is the Windows directory.  The
-; path in which the php.ini file is looked for can be overridden using
-; the -c argument in command line mode.

 ; The syntax of the file is extremely simple.  Whitespace and Lines
 ; beginning with a semicolon are silently ignored (as you probably guessed).
